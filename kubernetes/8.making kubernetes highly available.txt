The process
-create the reliable nodes that will form our cluster.(speacially master)
*****very IMP***-redundant and reliable storage service with a multinode deployment of etcd
start replicating and load balanced kubernetes api servers
-setup a master-elected kubernetes scheduler ad controller manager daemons
*******everything that needs the api server or any other service on the master goes through the load balancer includint the worker nodes


Step 1

 -make the mster node reliable
 -ensure services automatically restart if they fail
 -kubelet already does this
 -if kubelet goes down dn v need monit on debian systems or systemctl on systemd to keep the kubelet going

Step 2 STORAGE LAYER
 
 -persistent storage
 -Clustered etcd already replicates the storage to all master instance in your cluster
 -to loose data all three master nodes would need to have disks fail at the same time

 -add additional reliability by increasing the size of the cluster from three to five nodes


 Step three -REPlicated API services

 -Create the initial log file so that docker will mount a file instead of a directory
  touch /var/log/kube-apiserver.log
  -refer image  8.1
  -kubelet monitors the directory /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
  -and will automatically create an instance of the kube-apiserver container using the pod definition specified in the file

  Step 4
   -Now when the state changes
   -controller mangers and scheduler
 -3 these processes must not modify the cluster's state simultaneouly(use a  lease-lock)
  - Each scheduler and controller manager can be launched with a --leader-elect flag
  ***************imp**************
   -the scheduler and controller-manager can be configured to talk to the api server that is on the same node (i.e 127.0.0.1)
    -it can also be configured using the  load balanced ip address of the api servers
 
   -The scheduler and controller-manager will complete the leader election process mentioned before using the --leader-elect flag
   -in case of a failure accessing the api server,the elected leader will not be able to renew the lease,causing a new leader to be elected
